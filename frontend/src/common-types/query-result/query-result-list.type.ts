 * Defines the result of a `react-query` query that returns a list of items.
 * This type is a wrapper around the `UseQueryResult` type from `react-query`, specifically designed to handle queries that return an array of items.

 * @template T The type of each item in the list returned by the query. This represents the expected structure of the items within the array.
 * @template E The error type returned if the query fails. Defaults to the standard `Error` type, but can be customized to represent specific error structures.
